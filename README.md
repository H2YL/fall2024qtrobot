To test:
- run ```python3 frame_server.py``` in one terminal
- run ```python3 0_main_menu.py``` in another terminal
- Use user1 and pass1 to log in (or sign up and make an account)

To start a new user session
- run ```make clean``` to delete all csv files and the token.json file

For faster testing
- The sample files can be copy+pasted from sample_files directory if you want to skip some steps
